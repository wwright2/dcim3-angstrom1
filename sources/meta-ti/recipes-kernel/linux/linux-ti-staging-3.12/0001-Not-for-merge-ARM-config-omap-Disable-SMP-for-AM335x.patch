Subject: [PATCH] Not-for-merge: ARM: config: omap: Disable SMP for AM335x
 build

SMP and SMP_ON_UP introduces some extra barriers and code many fast paths
including kernel lock functions.

Performance sensitive usecases like networking gets impacted because of this.
In typical production kernel which is targeted for single core device
like AM335x family, you don't want to take this hit.

Ideally one should just create a device specific config feed as done by all
typical distro's. Other option is to apply this specifically during build
time using recipe.

Whichever option, one definitely don't want this overhead for performance
critical usecases.

Disabling SMP in the build introduces one warining in cpuidle44xx.c driver
and fix is included in the series
